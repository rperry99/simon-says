## Thoughts

I have tried creating Simon Says about a year ago. I ended up giving up on it since I could not for the life of me figure out how to do it.

Here, I am using an array and looping though it for the answer and player patterns. I am sure there is an easier way to go about it, but this is the way I came up with and it works.
